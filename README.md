## 🚀 The Mission
I build high-velocity web applications and resilient technical infrastructure. My approach bridges the gap between **Modern Product Engineering** and **Enterprise Systems Administration**. 

In 2026, I believe engineering excellence is defined by three pillars:
1. **Architectural Discipline:** Human-led design and strict type-safety.
2. **AI Augmentation:** Leveraging agentic workflows to increase delivery velocity.
3. **Systems Ownership:** Automating the "bare metal" and the OS to ensure 100% reliability.
